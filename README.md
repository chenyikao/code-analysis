This project refactors my PhD. student projects into a path condition generator and code-analysis infra-structure for general Java programs rather than parallel (OpenMP) C/C++ programs.

From the empirical working experiences I learned that path condition techniques may work better in differential program testing rather than in race-condition detection.
